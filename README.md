# ENVS-193DS_homework-04_Yip-William

Contains code for homework 4 where a data set from North Temperate Lakes LTER on fish lengths and weights were used to answer the question: How does fish length predict fish weight for trout perch (across all sample years)? The dataset comes from this the EDI data portal: https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/codeGeneration?packageId=knb-lter-ntl.6.34&statisticalFileType=

The data file stores the dataset where the data comes from and the code folder stores the code for the homework including code for the visualizations and tests we ran. We created a linear model to see if fish length predicts fish weight for trout perch.
